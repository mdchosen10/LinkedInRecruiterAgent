# LinkedIn Recruiter Tool - Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architecture, data flow, and integration points of the LinkedIn Recruiter Tool.

## Application Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### 1. Electron Layer

- **Main Process** (`electron/main.js`): Handles application lifecycle, window management, and secure IPC communication
- **Preload Script** (`electron/preload.js`): Creates a secure bridge between Electron and the renderer process
- **Security Module** (`electron/security.js`): Implements security policies and credential management

### 2. React UI Layer

- **Components**: Reusable UI elements organized by feature area
- **Pages**: Full-page components representing main application sections
- **Contexts**: React Context API for state management
- **Services**: API communication and data processing

### 3. Data Management

- **Authentication**: Uses Electron's secure storage for credentials
- **State Management**: React Context API with reducers for global state
- **Data Persistence**: Electron-store for local storage with encryption

## State Management

The application uses React Context API for state management, with two main contexts:

1. **AuthContext**: Manages authentication state and user information
2. **DataContext**: Manages candidate data, filters, and evaluation criteria

## Data Flow

1. User authenticates via LinkedIn credentials
2. Main process securely stores credentials
3. UI requests data through the preload bridge
4. Main process handles API requests to LinkedIn
5. Data is passed back to the UI via IPC
6. UI updates based on the received data

## Integration Points

### LinkedIn API Integration

The application connects to LinkedIn's Recruiter API for:

1. **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 flow for secure access
2. **Candidate Data**: Retrieving candidate profiles and information
3. **Messaging**: Sending and tracking outreach messages
4. **Analytics**: Collecting recruiting metrics and activity data

Integration points are implemented in the `src/services` directory:

- `auth.js`: Handles authentication with LinkedIn API
- `candidates.js`: Manages candidate data retrieval and updates
- `messaging.js`: Handles sending and tracking messages

### Backend API Integration

For a production deployment, the application would connect to a backend server that:

1. Stores candidate data and evaluation metrics
2. Provides analytics and reporting
3. Manages user accounts and permissions
4. Handles LinkedIn API rate limiting and caching

Endpoints would be structured as:

- `/api/auth/*`: Authentication and user management
- `/api/candidates/*`: Candidate data operations
- `/api/messages/*`: Messaging operations
- `/api/analytics/*`: Recruiting metrics and reports

## Security Considerations

1. **Credential Storage**: LinkedIn credentials are encrypted using electron-store
2. **API Communication**: All API requests use HTTPS with proper authentication
3. **Context Isolation**: Electron's contextIsolation prevents access to Node APIs from the renderer
4. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
5. **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy headers prevent XSS attacks

## Error Handling

The application implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

1. **UI Feedback**: Error states and loading indicators for all async operations
2. **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallbacks for when LinkedIn API is unavailable
4. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for transient failures

## Future Extensibility

The architecture allows for future enhancements:

1. **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom features
2. **Multiple ATS Integration**: Support for additional recruiting platforms
3. **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Integration points for intelligent candidate matching
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Framework for detailed reporting and insights
5. **Team Collaboration**: Structure for multi-user permissions and workflows

## Deployment Considerations

For production deployment, consider:

1. **Auto-Updates**: Implement Electron's auto-updater for seamless updates
2. **Analytics**: Usage tracking for feature optimization
3. **Error Reporting**: Automated error reporting for quick issue identification
4. **Code Signing**: Sign the application for security and trust
5. **Distribution**: Package for various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
