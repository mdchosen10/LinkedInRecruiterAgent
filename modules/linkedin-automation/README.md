Configuration
The module can be customized with various options:

javascript
const automation = new LinkedInAutomation({
  headless: false,              // Set to true for production use
  downloadPath: '/path/to/downloads',
  userDataDir: '/path/to/user_data',
  rateLimit: {
    requestsPerHour: 30,        // Maximum requests per hour
    cooldownPeriod: 10000,      // Milliseconds between actions
  },
  retryOptions: {
    maxRetries: 3,
    retryDelay: 5000,
  }
});
Basic Usage
Here's a basic example of using the module:

javascript
const LinkedInAutomation = require('./linkedin-automation');

async function main() {
  const automation = new LinkedInAutomation();
  
  try {
    // Initialize browser
    await automation.init();
    
    // Login to LinkedIn
    await automation.login('your-email@example.com', 'your-password');
    
    // Get job applicants
    const jobId = '3634275222'; // Example job ID
    const applicants = await automation.getApplicants(jobId);
    
    // Process each applicant
    for (const applicant of applicants) {
      // Get comprehensive profile data
      const profileData = await automation.getProfileData(applicant.profileUrl);
      console.log(profileData);
      
      // Try to download CV
      const cvResult = await automation.downloadCV(applicant.profileUrl);
      if (cvResult.success) {
        console.log(`CV downloaded to: ${cvResult.filePath}`);
      }
    }
    
    // Logout and cleanup
    await automation.logout();
    await automation.close();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    await automation.close();
  }
}

main();
Electron Integration
The module is designed to integrate seamlessly with Electron applications:

Main Process: Import and initialize the automation module
IPC Communication: Set up secure communication between main and renderer processes
UI Integration: Create a user-friendly interface for controlling the automation
See the electron-integration.js and preload.js files for implementation details.

Rate Limiting Considerations
LinkedIn has mechanisms to detect automation. To avoid detection:

Keep the rate limit low (30 requests per hour or less)
Add randomized delays between actions
Use a consistent user agent and browser fingerprint
Avoid running the automation for extended periods
Error Handling
The module includes comprehensive error handling:

Automatic retries with exponential backoff
Detailed error messages for debugging
Graceful handling of common LinkedIn issues (e.g., security checks)
Security Considerations
When using this module:

Never hardcode credentials in your application
Use environment variables or secure credential storage
Always run with the minimum required permissions
Consider implementing additional encryption for extracted data
Debugging
For debugging, set the headless option to false to see the browser in action:

javascript
const automation = new LinkedInAutomation({
  headless: false,
  // other options...
});
Building for Distribution
For packaging your Electron application with this module:
