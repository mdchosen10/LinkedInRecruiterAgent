# LinkedIn Recruiter Agent - Quick Start Guide

I'm working on an Electron app with React frontend called LinkedInRecruiterAgent. We've been troubleshooting issues with button functionality where buttons in the React UI weren't triggering actions properly.

## Current Progress

We've implemented a comprehensive multi-layered solution:

1. **Robust Preload Script** (`robust-preload.js`): Properly bridges Electron and React
2. **DOM Injector** (`dom-injector.js`): Adds direct UI controls that bypass React
3. **Event Interceptor** (`event-interceptor.js`): Intercepts events at the document level
4. **Button Fixer** (`button-fixer.js`): Uses MutationObserver to handle buttons
5. **Global Debugger** (`global-debugger.js`): Provides diagnostics and console access

## Current Status

- The Logout button is now working
- We need to verify the LinkedIn Browser and Start Extraction buttons

## Debug Tools

- Press **Ctrl+Alt+D** to toggle a debug panel with direct access buttons
- Use console commands:
  - `window.directLogout()` - For logout
  - `window.linkedInBrowserCommand()` - For LinkedIn browser
  - `window.startExtractionCommand()` - For extraction

## Project Path

The project is located at: `C:\Users\mdcho\AppData\Local\AnthropicClaude\app-0.9.3\LinkedInRecruiterAgent`

Please help me verify that the LinkedIn Browser and Start Extraction buttons are working with our solution, and make any necessary improvements.
